# Devlog
## 9/12/25
Setup project working on ball bounce have idea. 2d badminton like mario tennis top down. Implemented ball bouncing physics
## 9/13/25
Decided that I am going to make volleyball game I think. However if it fails or I get done with it I might take the code and make a top down minigolf game with a ball that can go up vertically. I think volleyball could be cool because it takes the direction of Mario Tennis and changes it up a bit.
